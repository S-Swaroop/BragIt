## üí°Inspiration

What is the first thing which comes to your mind when you hear the words beach, ocean, and summer, for our team it was fun and amusement. Another thing our team strongly believes in is Collaboration. And hence, we got to market research to find the blend of the two ideas and surprisingly found that there aren‚Äôt any applications that support community building and bring people together to collaborate and have summer fun by doing activities like playing volleyball, frisbee, and other water sports like jet skiing, etc. together, and hence, created our solution BeachMates.

## üíª What it does

Our application provides a platform where anyone can share their thoughts anonymously. 

Our application provides the following functionalities :

- creating, editing and deleting posts (You will love the implementation, even your email address is not stored in the database, it is just used once and discarded!!)
- commenting on a post anonymously.



## üö© How we built it

The ideation stage: After an intense brainstorming session it was apparent that the present social media apps - like Facebook, Twitter are a hit even after the rising claims of data thef on them,  and passionate people are always looking to meet others of the same interests, so we thought of keeping the idea behind such platform and discarding the parts which gave rise to such claims. And so we arrived at the idea to make an anonymous micro-blogging site for users to express themselves freely.

UI: An easy-to-use and all-inclusive UI was our main priority and with that in mind we selected a neutral color palette and a material design that went along with our theme - minimalistic and simple. We designed the UI on Figma and spent hours refining the small details, but we still believe more potentialities are based on awaiting. The UI decisions were not easy and involved intense discussions. 

The development stage: To divide the work evenly among teammates so that noone is pressured with a lot of responsibilities we decided to divide into two group, one to impletment a REST Api in the backend and another to create the UI and frontend logic using ReactJs, so that both these groups could work independently and efficiently.


## ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Challenges we ran into:

During the ideation stage and system design we had a tough time coming up with the anonymous password approach. We also made sure after brainstorming that we will not even store the email of the ueser once it has been used! 

While developing the app we came across many problems such as configuring the backend rest api for smooth data retrieval. We had tough time arranging and styling the react components as well because there were quite a few of them and we did not had prior experience working with the same. We also did have problems integrating the search component in the home page, because of different endpoints used in both. We did run into a few problems while deploying as well, as it was our first time deploying multi-page react application.

Bringing the whole team in line with the vision and vibe of the theme whilst maintaining an unbiased perspective, and promoting innovative ideas was a tumultuous task.

## üëè Accomplishments we are proud of:

We are proud of to come up and successfully implement and maintain the anonymity of the user, even though we do take the email at one point to provide the user with password we never store it.
